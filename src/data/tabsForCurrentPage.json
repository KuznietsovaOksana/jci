  "overview": "Our volunteer project 'Housing for IDP' is dedicated to helping internally displaced persons (IDPs) find safe and comfortable living arrangements. We work closely with local organizations and government agencies to provide housing solutions for those who have been forced to flee their homes due to conflict, natural disasters, or other reasons. Volunteers in this project may assist with building or repairing homes, providing basic needs like food and clothing, or helping IDPs navigate the complex process of finding and securing housing.
